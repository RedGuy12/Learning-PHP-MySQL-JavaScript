Here is some code from the book <i>Learning <span class="php">PHP</span>, <span class="mysql">MySQL</span> & <span class="js">JavaScript</span> with <span class="jquery">jQuery</span>, <span class="css">CSS</span> & <span class="html">HTML<span class="notBold">5</span></span> </i> by Robin Nixon.
<br>The aim of the code is to teach me about associative arrays.
<br>I made two arrays, but unlike the previous examples where I added ech item one-by-one, I added all of the items to the array at once! For both of them, I used one of PHP's built-in 


functions to print them all out.
<br>See what it evaluates to over there ðŸ‘‰ !
